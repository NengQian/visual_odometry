### Installation
```mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make```


### Todo
* Extract feature points
* Match feature points

### Eight-Point Algorithm [1]
Estimate the essential matrix for two given frames and intrinsic camera parameters followed by triangulation of matched point features.

### Direct Image Alignment
Directly align two images.
